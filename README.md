# Checklists
## Assignment
✔ product: product name, price, category, and availability.  
✔ search bar that filters the product list based on the product name.  
- Add filters for category and availability status, allowing users to select multiple filters at once.  
✔ Include a sort feature that allows users to sort products by price.  
✔ Infinite Scrolling or Pagination: Allow users to load additional products as they scroll down (infinite scroll) or add a “Load More” button at the end of the product list.  
• Cache the product data so it doesn’t refetch on re-renders. Implement client-side caching.  
✔ Dark Mode.  
• Write unit tests.  

## Issues
 • no more than 999 rows if table is a grid table is used.
 • scroll down, change category => the lenght is reduced so more rows will be loading.
 • sorting will only sort currently visible.
